### While you may use those templates directly, it's recommended to generate the desired flavor by the use of the `gev` command, so the latest packages are installed and the configurations related to you and your project are used.

#### Some flavoyrs, like `expo`, may have a '-' at its name ending. Expo, as example, would complain the name conflicted with the dependency with the same name.
