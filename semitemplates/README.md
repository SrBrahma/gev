Those are just some files that will be copied to the final boilerplate. Some other files and some changes to those files are done programatically by each flavor.

To take a look to the final results for each flavor, see **../templates** dir.

NOTE: The **.gitignore** is named here as **gitignore** due to https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3763. We rename it to **.gitignore** during the project generation process.
