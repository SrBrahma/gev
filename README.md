test [#18](https://github.com/SrBrahma/gev/issues/18)

# gev

A slightly opinionated tool to fastly create new projects with a single command. My projects are generated by this.

Creating new Typescript projects' environments is a real pain. Takes lots of minutes, sufferings and procrastinations to leave it functional and in the way we feel confortable. *We know how boring it is!*

<!-- There is a [templates](./templates) directory that contains all flavors boilerplates generated using the latest gev version. -->


# ðŸ“– Usage:

```bash
npx gev <flavor> # To use the current directory as destination and package name. Directory emptiness will be checked.

npx gev <flavor> <newPackageName> # To create a new directory and use it as the package name. Directory existence will be checked.

npx gev -h # For help and all commands and options available.
```

Current available flavors are:

**`ts`**: Typescript

**`ts-esm`**: Typescript ESM

**`expo`**: Expo

**`expo-pkg`**: Expo/React-Native package

**`rn`**: React Native

**`next`**: NextJS

**`chrome-react`**: Google Chrome extension with React

All the flavors uses Typescript. There may be other flavors that I didn't add here yet, run `npx gev -h` for all the latest flavors.

To supress the npm@7 possible npx confirmation message, you can use `npx -y gev`.

# ðŸ”® Future

* `vsce`, `cli` flavors

* Interactive menu to add other badges and the paypal button to the README.

* jest integration

* Allow custom setups. It could be something like `npx gev -u githubUsername`. This could really be a good way for people to have their own environment setup without too much work.

* `npx gev` would open an interactive menu to choose the desired initializer or change user options.

# ðŸ“° [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
