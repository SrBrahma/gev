# gev

A slightly opinionated tool to fastly create new projects with a single command.

Creating new Typescript projects' environments is a real pain. Takes lots of minutes, sufferings and procrastinations to leave it functional and in the way we feel confortable. *We know how boring it is!*

<!-- There is a [templates](./templates) directory that contains all flavors boilerplates generated using the latest gev version. -->


# ðŸ“– Usage:

```bash
npx gev <flavor> # To use the current directory as destination and package name. Directory emptiness will be checked.

npx gev <flavor> <newPackageName> # To create a new directory and use it as the package name. Directory existence will be checked.

npx gev -h # For help and all commands and options available.
```

Current available flavors are:

**`ts`**: Typescript project

**`ts-rsm`**: Typescript ESM project

**`expo`**: Expo project.

**`expo-pkg`**: React-Native/Expo component package.

All the flavors uses Typescript.

To supress the npm@7 possible npx confirmation message, you can use `npx -y gev`.

# ðŸ”® Future

* Add Paypal donate button to the end of READMEs (or as a badge). Also funding.yml file.

* Interactive menu to add other badges and the paypal button to the README.

* jest integration

* Allow custom setups. It could be something like `npx gev -u githubUsername`. This could really be a good way for people to have their own environment setup without too much work.

* Use `npm get` and `set` for local configs. Could store Github username, donation link, some **package.json** defaults and custom gev scripts to be used as default.

* `npx gev` would open an interactive menu to choose the desired initializer or change user options.
